Project Timeline / Status

    Currently in advanced development.
    Core features are functional and ready for testing and refinement.

Value Proposition

Problem Statement

    Accurately analyzing and counting bacterial colonies is a fundamental task in microbiological research.
    However, balancing precision and efficiency presents significant challenges.

Existing Methods

    Manual Counting
        Advantages: No additional equipment or software required
        Drawbacks: Time-consuming, labor-intensive, and diverts focus from data analysis

    Automated Counting Systems
        Advantages: Fast, consistent, and precise
        Drawbacks: Require expensive hardware and complex proprietary software

The Dilemma

    Biologists face two difficult options:
        1. Invest thousands of dollars in commercial automated systems
        2. Rely on manual methods, sacrificing time and productivity

Our Solution

    This project bridges the gap by offering an accessible, accurate, and user-friendly image analysis tool
    that provides the benefits of automationâ€”without the financial or technical burden.

Target Audience

    Microbiology researchers and laboratory technicians seeking a cost-effective colony analysis solution.

Core Features and Benefits

    Free and Open Source
        No licensing costs. Ideal for research labs with limited budgets.

    Simple, One-Click Workflow
        Designed for ease of use. A core analysis task can be completed with a single click.
        No advanced technical knowledge required.

    Manual Editing Support
        Users can manually add or delete colonies. This is essential for cases involving:
            Thick-rimmed Petri dishes
            Poor lighting
            Noisy or low-contrast images
        This hybrid approach ensures accurate results across a variety of conditions.

Comparison with Existing Solutions

    Commercial systems may offer similar accuracy but come with high costs and proprietary constraints.
    This tool achieves comparable functionality without expensive hardware or complex licensing models.

Technical Implementation

    Frontend / UI
        Developed using PyQt6.
        Users can upload images, view thumbnails, and open dedicated analysis windows.
        The interface supports efficient image management and review.

    Backend / Image Processing
        Petri dish isolation is performed using OpenCV.
        Images are then passed to ImageJ (via PyImageJ) for particle analysis and ROI management.

    File Management
        Images are saved to disk to preserve workspace continuity.
        Processed images and ROI data can be saved and exported to maintain analysis history.

Data Flow

    1. Image is uploaded and saved to disk
    2. Thumbnail appears in the main UI
    3. Clicking the thumbnail opens an analysis window
    4. Existing ROI data is loaded if present; otherwise, analysis is performed
    5. OpenCV identifies the Petri dish
    6. ImageJ detects colonies using particle analysis
    7. ROIs can be saved or updated, and results exported as CSV files

Development Challenges and Solutions

    Petri Dish Detection Performance
        Initial implementation using OpenCV's Hough Circle Transform was inefficient with high-resolution images.
        This caused long processing times and false detections.

        Solution:
            The image is downscaled to 1% of its original size before detection.
            Coordinates are scaled back to match the original image.
            The center-most circle is selected, assuming the dish is centered.
            This significantly improved both performance and accuracy.

    ImageJ GUI Integration
        The default ImageJ GUI opened separate windows, creating a disjointed experience.

        Solution:
            ImageJ is now embedded directly into the PyQt interface.
            This improves workflow consistency and user experience.
